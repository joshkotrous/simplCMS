# Create a new project

Creating a new SimplCMS project is straightforward.

## Quick Start

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx simplcms@latest create-app
```

This command creates a new Next.js project with SimplCMS installed and pre-configured.

## Configure Environment Variables

You have two options for configuring your environment variables:

### 1. Manual Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project's root folder and fill it in according to the [prerequisites guide](./prerequisites).

### 2. Configuration Wizard

SimplCMS provides a convenient setup wizard accessible at:

```
http://localhost:3000/admin/setup
```

This wizard will guide you through the process of setting up your environment variables interactively.

## Run the Development Server

To start the development server locally, navigate to your project directory and execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your SimplCMS project should now be running locally and accessible at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
