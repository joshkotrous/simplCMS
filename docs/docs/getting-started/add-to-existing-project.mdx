# Add to an Existing Project

SimplCMS can easily be integrated into your existing Next.js application.

## Integration Steps

Run the following command in your existing project's directory:

```bash
npx simplcms@latest init
```

This command performs the following:

- Installs SimplCMS and its required dependencies.
- Sets up the necessary admin routes and includes the `SimplCMSRouter` component and route.
- Configures NextAuth.js integration by including the `SimplCMSAuth` component and route.

## Configure Environment Variables

After initialization, configure your environment variables using one of the following options:

### 1. Manual Setup

Manually create a `.env` file at your project's root and populate it based on the [prerequisites guide](./prerequisites).

### 2. Configuration Wizard

Use the built-in SimplCMS setup wizard by visiting:

```
http://localhost:3000/admin/setup
```

The wizard will assist you interactively in configuring the necessary environment variables.

## Running Your Project

Once setup is complete, launch your development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your integrated SimplCMS admin panel will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```
