# Markdown Features

SimplCMS offers robust Markdown support, enabling you to effortlessly format your content directly within the text editor.

## Formatting and Media Upload

Within SimplCMS, you can easily:

- Format text using standard Markdown syntax:
  - Bold, italics, strikethrough
  - Headings
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Links and images
- Upload media directly within the editor for seamless embedding.

## Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Enhance your technical content using fenced code blocks that support syntax highlighting. Simply wrap your code snippet as shown below:
````markdown
```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello, SimplCMS!</div>;
}
```
````

Syntax highlighting works automatically for popular programming languages.

## Markdown Renderer

SimplCMS provides a customizable `MarkdownRenderer` component that you can easily use within your application:

```jsx
import { MarkdownRenderer } from 'simplcms';

export default function BlogContent({ markdown }) {
  return <MarkdownRenderer content={markdown} />;
}
```

If preferred, you can use your own Markdown renderer for further customization and flexibility.
