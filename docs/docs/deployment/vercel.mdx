# Vercel

SimplCMS can easily be deployed to Vercel.

## Steps to Deploy

1. Connect your SimplCMS repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Deploy your site using Vercel's automated deployment.
3. Configure your environment variables either manually or using the SimplCMS setup wizard.

### Using the Setup Wizard

After deployment, access your deployed site's setup wizard at:

```
https://your-domain.com/admin/setup
```

This wizard will guide you through configuring your environment variables interactively.

### Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can manually set your environment variables in Vercel's project settings:

- Navigate to your Vercel dashboard.
- Go to **Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables**.
- Enter the required variables based on the [prerequisites guide](./prerequisites).

Once deployed, your SimplCMS admin panel will be available at:

```
https://your-domain.com/admin
```
