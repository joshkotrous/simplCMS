# Self-hosting

SimplCMS supports self-hosting on your preferred platform, such as AWS, DigitalOcean, Docker, and others.

## Steps to Self-host

1. Deploy your SimplCMS application to your chosen hosting provider.
2. Manually configure the required environment variables based on your setup. Refer to the [prerequisites guide](./prerequisites) for detailed information.

> **Note:** The SimplCMS setup wizard is **not available** for self-hosted deployments; all configurations must be handled manually.

Once successfully deployed and configured, your SimplCMS admin panel will be accessible at:

```
https://your-domain.com/admin
```
